# Author articles: what was checked, and what was left out

Method (owner's decision, 2026-09-30): take the old site's draft (`old-site-author-articles.json`), check every claim against a
real source, rewrite in plain, lively English, keep only what holds, and record the sources in `web/src/wiki/authors/<id>.ts`.
Ancient passages are cited as links into the Scroll (the site's own copy of the texts); modern works by publisher, catalogue or
review page. The reader can follow each footnote number to its source at the bottom of the author's page.

## Herodotus (tlg0016), checked 2026-09-30

**Confirmed and kept**
- Opening words, Halicarnassus, "inquiry", the cause of the war: Hdt. 1.1.0 (the site's text).
- ἱστορίη / θωμαστά / κότε / ἀπίκετο are Ionic forms: LSJ entries (ἱστορία "Ion. -ιη", θαυμαστός "Ion. θωμ-", κότε "Ion. for πότε", ἀφικνέομαι "Ion. ἀπ-"), read in the site's copy of LSJ.
- Cicero, *De Legibus* 1.5: "apud Herodotum patrem historiae et apud Theopompum sunt innumerabiles fabulae".
- Born about 484: Gellius 15.23 (Pamphila: Herodotus 53 at the war's start). Livius.org gives c. 480–c. 429, so the dates are marked debated.
- Still writing after 430: Hdt. 7.137.3 and Thuc. 2.67 (end of the second summer; 2.47.1 closes the first year).
- Travel and method: Hdt. 2.29.1, 2.44.1, 2.99.1, 7.152.3.
- Plutarch, *On the Malice of Herodotus*: chapter 1 (the charge, Boeotians and Corinthians); chapter 26 (Diyllus: ten talents, decree of Anytus). Marked as tradition.
- Lucian, *Herodotus* 1 (Olympia; books named after the Muses). Marked as tradition.
- The Persian debate: Hdt. 3.80.1–2, 6.43.3. Solon and Croesus: Hdt. 1.29–33; Plutarch, *Solon* 27.1 (some prove by chronology that it is fictitious); Hollmann 2015, n. 68.
- The ending and the unkept promise: Hdt. 9.122.2–3, 7.213.3; Jona Lendering (Livius.org) for "probably unfinished".
- Manuscript families, sigla, papyri, apparatus examples (ἄποδος / ἄφοδος at 4.97.4; Hemmerdinger): Verhasselt's edition of a Book 4 papyrus (KU Leuven repository). A (Laur. plut. 70.3): tenth century, parchment, 374 leaves: Biblissima.
- Nine books by Alexandrian scholars in the third century BC: Livius.org.
- Valla's Latin translation, Venice 1474 (Jacobus Rubeus): Whitmore catalogue, and the History of Information page (seen through a search result only: the page itself would not open).
- Aldine Greek edition 1502: Wikipedia's list of editiones principes (and its "Editio princeps" page).
- Editions: Godley (Loeb 1920–25, named in the TEI header of the site's Greek and English); Wilson OCT 2015 (two volumes; replaces Hude; two neglected Roman-family manuscripts collated), from the OUP page as quoted in a search result and the Journal of Hellenic Studies review record; Rosén (Teubner, vol. 1, 1987, lxxxviii + 458 pp.; vol. 2, 1997), Classical Review record; Asheri, Lloyd, Corcella (OUP 2007), BMCR review.

**Left out because it could not be confirmed**
- "Plutarch says many readers made that change" (of Halicarnassus to of Thurii): not found in Plutarch's essays read; Aristotle's "of Thurii" is kept.
- Dates for manuscripts B, D and the others (draft: eleventh / eleventh or twelfth century): no reliable source found; only A's date is kept.
- Travels "in Egypt, the Levant, Scythia" beyond what his own text says; "public readings at Athens" (the Olympia tale and the ten talents are kept as tradition); "joins the colony of Thurii in 443"; the Suda's life (the Suda's page would not open).
- The *Acharnians* parody of 425 and "death shortly after 425".
- Thucydides as an early critic (he never names Herodotus; scholars' reading could not be sourced).
- Nothing on the "Roman family: R, S, V" beyond Verhasselt's list.

**Corrected from the draft**
- "Hellenistic scholars" → third-century BC scholars at Alexandria (Livius.org).
- "The latest datable events belong to c. 431–425" → a firm date of 430 (Hdt. 7.137 with Thuc. 2.67).
- "Several dozen papyri, mostly from Oxyrhynchus" → 44 published (Verhasselt); "mostly Oxyrhynchus" not confirmed.
- "Neither family is consistently better" → not stated by the source; left out.

**Weak points to revisit**
- Bibliographic details of the OUP Wilson and the Loeb volumes rest on search-result summaries and review records because the publishers' pages would not open in the fetch tool.
- Wikipedia's list is the only source for the year of the Aldine edition (a bibliographic fact widely given; replace with a library catalogue record when one can be opened).
